   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Learning Larch, an X-ray analysis package for synchrotron applications
======================================================================

`Larch manual <http://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/index.html>`_

`Larch Plugin Tutorial <https://www.gitbook.com/book/bruceravel/larch-plugin-tutorial/details>`_

This document is intended as a gentle introduction to using Larch with
an emphasis on solving some of the most common problems that
synchrotron users face in the areas of simple numerical analysis and
analysis of their XAS, XRF, or XRD data.  This is not meant to replace
the `Larch manual <http://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/index.html>`_.
In fact, in many ways, this document is much less complete than the
Larch manual.  

Say some more about when and why of this document vs. the Larch manual...
